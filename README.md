Project- IPL ANALYSIS
Project Objective: In order to gain different insights, this project will analyse Indian Premier League (IPL) data from 2008 until 2020. Principal goals are to: 
1. List the winners of each season's IPL championship. 
2. Select each season's Orange Cap (most run scorer) and Purple Cap (highest wicket-taker) winners. 
3. Compute how many fours and sixes are hit in a given season overall. 
The impact of winning the toss on the result of the game should be examined, along with the proportion of winners who decide to bowl or bat. 

• Import Data: • Open Tableau and import the gathered data. 
• Verify that the data is consistent and well-structured, free of errors or missing values. 
• Transform data: Construct calculated fields to get the total number of fours and sixes for every season. 
• Apply filters on the data for seasons 2008–2020. 
• If needed, merge data from several sources to provide season summaries, player performance, and match specifics. 

Results 
1. IPL Title Winners: 
The most successful teams over time can be found. 
Dominant teams include the Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings. 
The Orange Cap and Purple Cap Winners serve as a means of showcasing both emerging stars and consistent top performers across various seasons. 
Players like Chris Gayle and Virat Kohli have won the Orange Cap on multiple occasions, and bowlers like Lasith Malinga have been strong candidates for the Purple Cap. 

2. Total Fours and Sixes: 
As the tournament progresses, more fours and sixes are being hit, illustrating the growing tendency of aggressive batting. 
Higher numbers of borders indicate more aggressive play throughout some seasons, particularly in later years. 

3. Toss's Impact on Winning: o Examining how toss selections affect the results of matches. 
The team that wins the toss wins a sizable portion of games, indicating that the toss can be an important aspect. 
Teams frequently like to chase, as evidenced by the proportion of teams that, after winning the toss, opt to bowl first. 

4. Dashboard and Visualization:
Interactive Dashboards: To display different indicators and trends in the IPL data, create interactive dashboards. 
Storytelling with Data: Craft engrossing tales about significant IPL events using visuals. 


Conclusion, 
This analysis's use of Tableau makes it possible to create dynamic, interactive visualisations that facilitate the discovery of patterns and other insights from the IPL data. By giving a thorough summary of the IPL from 2008 to 2020, the graphic approach aids in the efficient communication of the findings.
